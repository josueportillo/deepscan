**************************************Deepscan Network Scanner*********************************************

Scans the selected network(s) for alive hosts and scans them for open ports. Creates separated text files
with relevant info and results in a conviniently organized folder tree.

* Release notes:

* v1.1                                                                                                      
Added selection menu for automated scan or manually setting target network.                                
Added this README file and made it accesible through menu option [3].

* v.1.0                                                                                                      
Scans the local host for directly connected networks and looks for hosts with open ports in those networks.
Automatically defines a folder tree for easy use of the results afterwards.                                 
Requires nmap to be installed. Soon I'll be adding auto-install capabilities for the dependencies.
